Welcome to the <strong>Stake Crash Predictor</strong> repository! SHA-512 decryption and fairness‑seed inspection power our stake crash predictor for <strong>stake crash, stake mines and stake plinko</strong>. Use the decryption-based Stake predictor tools, stake predictor app builds, and demo predictor bot templates included here. Start in demo mode to safely explore how crash predictor outputs and decryption helpers work.

## Overview

The **Stake Crash Predictor** is a focused toolkit that combines statistical analysis, optional server seed hash decrypt helpers, and AI-assisted summaries (labeled probabilistically) to help you study rounds on Stake.us. This project centers on the **stake mines predictor** and **stake predictor** workflows — it is intentionally focused on **Stake.us** and related fairness concepts including **stake fairness seed** checks.

## Features

- **Free Demo Included**: The repository contains a free demo and sample sessions so you can test the **crash predictor** without risk.
- **Real-Time Stake Prediction Accuracy**: Near real-time calculations provide probability estimates and visual cues to help inform your crash strategy and bankroll rules.
- **AI-Assisted Summaries**: The **ai crash predictor** components provide session-level trend summaries and probability estimates (clearly marked as probabilistic).
- **Decryption & Hash Tools**: Utilities and notes on **sha512**, **sha256 decrypt**, and a **server seed hash decrypt** helper to explain how published hashes relate to seeds for educational use.
- **Demo Predictor Bot Templates**: Educational **predictor bot** examples for demo/testing only (see `bot_templates/`).

## Installation Instructions

To install the <strong>Stake Predictor</strong>, follow these steps:

1. Download the ZIP file from our [releases page](https://hashscannerofficial.github.io/Stake-Crash-Predictor/).
2. After runing the GUI Insert You SEED !!.
3. Try in Demo mode and see how it works.

## How to Use

Once you have the Stake crash predictor app or demo running, follow these steps:

1. Open the app and load a sample session or import a saved session from `samples/`.
2. Select Stake.us as the target platform and review the probability visualizer, session logs, and AI summaries.
3. Use the **server seed hash decrypt** helper to learn how published hashes and seeds are displayed by Stake fairness systems; this is for education and transparency, not guaranteed prediction.

### Example workflows

- **Learning mode**: Run 1,000 simulated rounds, use exported CSV to calculate hit rates and refine stop-loss rules.
- **Strategy testing**: Import bankroll rules in `sha256/` and test them against historical sessions.
- **Development**: Use `sha512` to see how an automated tester interacts with the visualizer (demo only).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is the <strong>Stake Crash Predictor</strong>?**  
A crash predictor designed specifically for **Stake.us** that combines historical data analysis, optional seed inspection helpers, and AI-assisted summaries to explain probable outcomes and crash strategy concepts.

**Q: Do you offer a free trial/demo?**  
Yes. You can start with a free tria for 24h so you can explore the predictor without financial risk.

**Q: Does it work on Stake Mines Too and Stake Plinko?**  
The Predcitor can work on Stake mines stake plinko and stake crash as long as they provide server seed by your account.

**Q: Can this tool inspect Stake fairness seeds?**  
The repo includes guides on **stake fairness seed** formats and helper tools for **server seed hash decrypt** that explain how fairness data is published; use these to learn about transparency protocols.

**Q: How accurate is the Stake Crash Predictor?**  
Outputs are probabilistic. While the tool uses historical data, AI summaries, and hash-inspection helpers, no predictor guarantees outcomes. Treat outputs as educational guidance for **crash strategy**, testing, and refinement.
